from sklearn.datasets import make_classification

# Create sample data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, random_state=42)
df = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=[f'feature_{i}' for i in range(20)])
df['target'] = y

# Initialize AutoML
automl = AutoMLite(
    time_budget=60,
    enable_ensemble=True,
    enable_feature_selection=True,
    enable_interpretability=True
)

# Train model
automl.fit(df.drop('target', axis=1), df['target'])

# Make predictions
predictions = automl.predict(X_test)

# Generate report
automl.generate_report('report.html')
```

## 📊 Results

Running this demo produces:
